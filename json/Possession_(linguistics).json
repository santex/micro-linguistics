For example, English uses a\npossessive clitic ('' 's ''), a preposition, of, and adjectives\n(my, your etc.). Predicates denoting possession may be formed using a verb such\nas English have, or by other means such as existential clauses (as is usual in\nlanguages such as Russian).\n","linknr":140,"url":"Possession_(linguistics)","recorded":1362570330,"links":13,"instances":["grammar","grammar"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Grammar"],"headings":["Alienable and inalienable","Inherent and non-inherent","Possessable and unpossessable","Clauses denoting possession","References","Further reading","See also"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["predicate","grammar"],["clause","grammar"]],"members":["predicate","clause"],"related":["Linguistics","Referent","Possessive_case","Possessed_case","Construct_state","Arabic_grammar","Adposition","Possessive_suffix","Possessive_adjective","Clitic","Saxon_genitive","Predicate_(grammar)","Existential_clause","Inalienable_possession","Mikasuki_language","Muskogean_languages","Florida","Polynesian_languages","Hawaiian_language","Maori_language","Yabem_language","Papua_New_Guinea","Maasai_language","Verb","Clause_(grammar)","Animacy","Georgian_language","Existential_clause","Russian_language","Bernd_Heine","Genitive_case","Possessive_adjective","Possessive_case","Possessive_pronoun","Possessive_suffix"]}
