There are two independent pieces of evidence for its\nexistence: the Extended Projection Principle (which states that all clauses must\nhave a subject) and theta criterion (which states that every argument a verb can\nassign must be realized):\n\n*I persuaded John [PRO to read Al Gore's latest book]\n\nIn the example above, PRO serves as the subject of the non-finite clause [to\nread Al Gore's latest book], thereby satisfying the EPP-feature of T (occupied\nby the infinitival 'to'). Since it is an object control sentence, 'John' is the\nantecedent of PRO, they are co-indexed.\n\nThe interpretation of PRO may be either dependent on another noun phrase (like\nanaphors) or arbitrary (like pronominals). That is why in terms of features PRO\nmay be described as [+anaphor, +pronominal]. However, this set of features would\npose a problem for Binding Theory: an anaphor must be bound in its governing\ncategory, whereas a pronominal must be free (in its governing category). The\nsolution that Chomsky proposed was the so called 'PRO Theorem': PRO must be\nungoverned. In other words, PRO cannot be governed and that is why it cannot\nhave a governing category.\n\nIn recent literature (Chomsky 1999, Radford 2004) the existence of PRO has been argued for without the help of the PRO\nTheorem and government theory. It is posited that PRO is in complementary\ndistribution with overt subjects because it is the only item that is able to\ncheck \"null case\" from a nonfinite T, namely the 'to' in control infinitives.\nBy positing this, the problems arising from the PRO Theorem are avoided. The\nproblem was that PRO serves as the subject of the control clause and must, as\nsuch, be case-marked. However, following the traditional G&B-framework, case-\nmarking only applies under government. Thus, PRO could not be case-marked\nsince it must be ungoverned. If PRO receives null-case, it is licensed to\nappear in subject position.\n\nOn the other hand, Norbert Hornstein (1999) has proposed that control verbs can\nbe explained without resort to PRO, and that PRO can be done away with entirely.\n","linknr":102,"url":"PRO_(linguistics)","recorded":1362535029,"links":16,"instances":["linguistics","linguistics","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Syntax"],"headings":["References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Linguistics_stub.svg/40px-Linguistics_stub.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["binding","linguistics"],["government","linguistics"],["subject","linguistics"]],"members":["government","subject","binding"],"related":["Empty_category","Government_and_Binding_Theory","Extended_Projection_Principle","Theta_criterion","Non-finite_clause","Argument_control","Noun_phrase","Anaphor","Pronominal","Binding_(linguistics)","Government_(linguistics)","Complementary_distribution","Subject_(linguistics)","Case_marking","Norbert_Hornstein"]}
