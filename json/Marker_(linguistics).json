{"cursor":"2273","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn linguistics, a 'marker' is a free or bound morpheme that indicates the\ngrammatical function of the marked word, phrase, or sentence. In analytic\nlanguages and agglutinative languages, markers are generally easily\ndistinguished. In fusional languages and polysynthetic languages, this is often\nnot the case. For example: in Latin -- a highly fusional language -- the word\namo (\"I love\") is marked by suffix -o for indicative mood, active voice, first\nperson, singular, present tense. Analytic languages tend to have a relatively\nlimited number of markers.\n\nMarkers should be distinguished from the linguistic concept of markedness. An\nunmarked form is the basic \"neutral\" form of a word, typically used as its\ndictionary lemma, such as â in English â for nouns the singular (e.g. cat versus\ncats), and for verbs the infinitive (e.g. to eat versus eats, ate and eaten).\nUnmarked forms (e.g. the nominative case in many languages) tend to be less\nlikely to have markers, but this is not true for all languages (compare Latin).\nConversely, a marked form may happen to have a zero affix, like the genitive\nplural of some nouns in Russian. In some languages, the same forms of a marker\nhave multiple functions, such as when used in different cases or declensions\n(for example -is in Latin).\n","linknr":119,"url":"Marker_(linguistics)","recorded":1362671383,"links":19,"instances":["linguistics","morphology","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Linguistic morphology"],"headings":["See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lemma","morphology"],["zero","linguistics"],["case","linguistics"],["lemma","morphology"]],"members":["zero","lemma","case"],"related":["Linguistics","Morpheme","Grammatical_function","Analytic_language","Agglutinative_language","Fusional_language","Polysynthetic_language","Markedness","Lemma_(morphology)","Nominative_case","Latin","Zero_(linguistics)","Genitive_case","Russian_language","Case_(linguistics)","Declension","Affix","Lexeme","Morpheme","Markedness","Lemma_(morphology)","Null_morpheme","Uninflected_word","Dependent-marking_language","Head-marking_language","Double-marking_language","Zero-marking_language"]}
