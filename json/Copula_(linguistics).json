{"cursor":"44125","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\nIn linguistics, a 'copula' (plural: 'copulas' or 'copulae') is a word used to\nlink the subject of a sentence with a predicate (a subject complement), such as\nthe word is in the sentence \"The sky 'is' blue.\" The word copula derives from\nthe Latin noun for a \"link\" or \"tie\" that connects two different things. See\nthe appendix to Moro 1997 and the references cited there for a short history of\nthe copula.\n\nA copula is often a verb or a verb-like word, though this is not universally the\ncase. A verb that is a copula is sometimes called a 'copulative' or\n'copular verb'. In English primary education grammar courses, a copula is often\ncalled a 'linking verb'. In other languages, copulas show more resemblances to\npronouns, as in Classical Chinese and Guarani, or may take the form of suffixes\nattached to a noun, as in Beja, Ket, and Inuit languages.\n\nMost languages have one main copula (although some, like Spanish and Thai, have\nmore than one, and some have none). In the case of English, this is the verb to\nbe. While the term copula is generally used to refer to such principal forms, it\nmay also be used to refer to some other verbs with similar functions, like\nbecome, get, feel and seem in English (these may also be called \"semi-copulas\"\nor \"pseudo-copulas\").\n","linknr":543,"url":"Copula_(linguistics)","recorded":1362555152,"links":47,"instances":["linguistics","grammar","grammar","grammar","grammar","grammar","linguistics","linguistics","grammar"],"pdf":["http://www.hpu.edu/CHSS/LangLing/TESOL/ProfessionalDevelopment/200680TWPfall06/04Kusutani_Syntax.pdf","http://www.hpu.edu/CHSS/LangLing/TESOL/ProfessionalDevelopment/200680TWPfall06/04Kusutani_Syntax.pdf"],"categories":["Parts of speech","Verb types"],"headings":["Grammatical function","Meanings","Forms","Additional uses of copular verbs","Zero copula","Additional copulas","Copulas in particular languages","See also","Notes","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["subject","grammar"],["sentence","linguistics"],["predicate","grammar"],["subject","grammar"],["clause","grammar"],["predicate","grammar"],["complement","grammar"],["ellipsis","grammar"],["agreement","linguistics"],["zero","linguistics"],["perfect","grammar"],["predicate","grammar"],["predicate","grammar"]],"members":["sentence","subject","complement","perfect","predicate","clause","agreement","zero","ellipsis"],"related":["Linguistics","Subject_(grammar)","Sentence_(linguistics)","Predicate_(grammar)","Subject_complement","Latin","Verb","Primary_education","Grammar","Pronoun","Classical_Chinese","Guarani_language","Suffix","Beja_language","Ket_language","Inuit_languages","Spanish_language","Thai_language","Subject_(grammar)","Clause_(grammar)","Predicate_(grammar)","Predicative_expression","Noun_phrase","Prepositional_phrase","Verb_phrase","Complement_(grammar)","Adjective","Word_order","Subject-verb-object","Subject–auxiliary_inversion","Inverse_copular_constructions","Null-subject_language","Non-finite_clause","Participial_phrase","Infinitive_phrase","Ellipsis_(grammar)","Verb_phrase_ellipsis","Inverse_copular_constructions","Noun_phrase","Verb_phrase","Agreement_(linguistics)","Referent","Subset","Verb","Grammatical_category","Grammatical_tense","Grammatical_aspect","Grammatical_mood","Irregular_verb","Suppletion","English_verbs","Pronoun","Classical_Chinese","Guarani_language","Synthetic_language","Suffix","Inuit_languages","Beja_language","Ket_language","Grammatical_conjugation","Predicative_verb","Clitic","Zero_(linguistics)","English_auxiliaries","Passive_voice","Past_participle","Progressive_aspect","Present_participle","Perfect_(grammar)","To-infinitive","English_conditional_sentences","Existence","Ontology","Aristotle","Abelard","Expletive_pronoun","Existential_clause","Inverse_copular_construction","Russian_language","Hungarian_language","Arabic_language","Hebrew_language","Quechuan_languages","African_American_vernacular_English","Southern_Quechua","Lojban","Irish_language","Predicate_(grammar)","Semantic","List_of_English_copulae","English_subjunctive","English_verbs","Indo-European_copula","Disputes_in_English_grammar","Double_copula","Indo-European_language","Cognate","Proto-Indo-European_language","Georgian_language","South_Caucasian_languages","German_language","Indo-European_languages","Romance_languages","Vulgar_Latin","Principal_parts","Principal_parts","Iberian_Romance_languages","Inflection","Slavic_language","Instrumental_case","Nominative_case","East_Slavic_languages","Irish_language","Scottish_Gaelic","Syntax","Verb–subject–object","Irish_syntax","Haitian_Creole_language","French-based_creole_language","Zero_copula","Pidgin","Dummy_pronoun","Japanese_language","Predicate_(grammar)","Honorific_speech_in_Japanese","Addressee","Stative_verb","Theories","Kansai_dialect","Hiroshima","Japanese_language","Simplified_Chinese","Standard_Chinese","Pinyin","Chinese_language","Stative_verb","Chinese_adjectives","Han_Dynasty","Demonstrative_pronoun","Classical_Chinese","Etymology","Hokkien","Wu_Chinese","Cantonese","Jyutping","Hakka_language","Medicine_man","Lakota_language","Constructed_language","Lojban","E-Prime","Esperanto","Ido","Interlingua","Nominal_sentence","Stative_verb"]}
