{"cursor":"13990","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"In linguistics, 'control' is a construction where the understood subject of a\ngiven predicate is determined by some expression in context. Stereotypical\ninstances of control involve verbs. A superordinate verb \"controls\" a\nsubordinate, non-finite verb. Control was intensively studied in the Government\nand Binding (GB) framework in the 1980s, and much of the terminology from that\nera is still used today. See for instance van Riemsdijk and Williams\n(1986:128ff.), Cowper (1992:161ff.), Borsley (1996:126-144). In the days\nof Transformational Grammar, control phenomena were discussed in terms of Equi-\nNP deletion. Concerning the designation Equi-NP deletion for control\nstructures, see for instance Bach (1974:116f.), Emonds (1976:193f. note 15),\nCulicover (1982:250). Control is often analyzed in terms of a null pronoun\ncalled PRO. Control is also related to raising, although there are important\ndifferences between control and raising. Most if not all languages have control\nconstructions and these constructions tend to occur frequently.\n","linknr":128,"url":"Control_(linguistics)","recorded":1362477625,"links":13,"instances":["linguistics","grammar","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Verb types"],"headings":["Examples","Control verbs vs. auxiliary verbs","Non-obligatory or optional control","Arbitrary control","Representing control","Control vs. raising","Notes","References","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/98/Control_trees_2.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/11/IP0001.jpg/300px-IP0001.jpg","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf9/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["predicate","grammar"],["raising","linguistics"],["argument","linguistics"],["raising","linguistics"],["predicate","grammar"],["argument","linguistics"],["raising","linguistics"]],"members":["argument","predicate","raising"],"related":["Linguistics","Predicate_(grammar)","Raising_(linguistics)","Argument_(linguistics)","Auxiliary_verb","Phrase_structure_grammar","Dependency_grammar","X-bar_theory","Raising_(linguistics)","Exceptional_case-marking","Dependency_grammar","Phrase_structure_grammar","Predicate_(grammar)","Argument_(linguistics)","Raising_(linguistics)"]}
