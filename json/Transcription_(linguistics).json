The source can either be utterances (speech) or\npreexisting text in another writing system, although some linguists consider\nonly the former to be transcription .\n\nTranscription should not be confused with translation, which means representing\nthe meaning of a source language text in a target language (e.g. translating the\nmeaning of an English text into Spanish), or with transliteration which means\nrepresenting a text from one script in another (e.g. transliterating a Cyrillic\ntext into the Latin script).\n\nIn the academic discipline of linguistics, transcription is an essential part of\nthe methodologies of (among others) phonetics, conversation analysis,\ndialectology and sociolinguistics. It also plays an important role for several\nsubfields of speech technology. Common examples for transcriptions outside\nacademia are the proceedings of a court hearing such as a criminal trial (by a\ncourt reporter) or a physician's recorded voice notes (medical transcription).\nThis article focuses on transcription in linguistics.\n","linknr":220,"url":"Transcription_(linguistics)","recorded":1362671880,"links":46,"instances":["captioning","digital","linguistics","software"],"pdf":["http://edlinked.soe.waikato.ac.nz/research/files/etpc/files/2007v6n1art1.pdf","http://www.exmaralda.org/files/azm_56.pdf","http://www.gespraechsforschung-ozs.de/heft2009/px-gat2.pdf"],"categories":["Phonetics","Subtitling","Writing","Transcription (linguistics)|"],"headings":["Phonetic vs. orthographic transcription","Transcription as theory","Transcription systems","Transcription software","See also","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["prosody","linguistics"],["container_format","digital"],["transcription","software"],["subtitle","captioning"],["transcription","service"],["transcription","software"]],"members":["subtitle","container_format","prosody","transcription"],"related":["Linguistics","Language","Utterance","Written_language","Writing_system","Translation","English_language","Spanish_language","Transliteration","Cyrillic_script","Latin_alphabet","Linguistics","Phonetics","Conversation_analysis","Dialectology","Sociolinguistics","Speech_technology","Court_hearing","Criminal_trial","Court_reporter","Physician","Medical_transcription","Phonetic_transcription","Orthographic_transcription","Orthography","International_Phonetic_Alphabet","International_Phonetic_Alphabet","Speech_Assessment_Methods_Phonetic_Alphabet","Gail_Jefferson","Conversation_Analysis","Prosody_(linguistics)","Pragmatics","Audio_file_format","Container_format_(digital)","Electronic_document","Multimodal_interaction","CHILDES","Endangered_language","EXMARaLDA","Praat","Transcriber","Transcription_(software)","Phonetic_transcription","Speech_recognition","Subtitle_(captioning)","Transcription_(service)","Transcription_(software)","Interlinear_gloss"]}
