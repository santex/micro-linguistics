{"cursor":"1995","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"Linkage}}\n\nIn linguistics, a 'linkage' is a group of undoubtedly related languages for\nwhich no proto-language can be reconstructed. Malcolm Ross, who coined the term,\ndefined it as âa group of communalects which have arisen by dialect\ndifferentiationâ .\n\nCommon to linkages are defining features absent from its geographic extremes. A\nlinkage may result when the members of a dialect chain diverge while sharing\nsubsequent innovations.\n\nAn example of a linkage is the one formed the Central Malayo-Polynesian\nlanguages of the Banda Sea (a sea in the South Moluccas in Indonesia). The CentralâEastern Malayo-Polynesian languages are commonly\ndivided into two branches, Central MP and Eastern MP, each having certain\ndefining features that unify them and distinguish them from the other. However,\nwhile proto-Eastern and proto-CentralâEastern MP languages can be reconstructed\n(the sibling and parent of Central MP, respectively), a proto-Central MP\nlanguage reconstruction does not seem feasible. It may be that the branches of\nCentral MP are each as old as Eastern MP, but that they went on to exchange\nfeatures that are now considered to define them as a family. In Eastern MP,\ncommon features can be assumed to have been present in the ancestral language,\nbut this is not the case for Central MP.\n","linknr":97,"url":"Linkage_(linguistics)","recorded":1362559710,"links":14,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Historical linguistics"],"headings":["Notes","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Linguistics_stub.svg/40px-Linguistics_stub.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Proto-language","Malcolm_Ross","Dialect_chain","Central_Malayo-Polynesian_languages","Banda_Sea","Indonesia","Central–Eastern_Malayo-Polynesian_languages","Eastern_Malayo-Polynesian_languages"]}
