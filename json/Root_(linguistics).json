However, sometimes the term \"root\" is also used to describe the word\nminus its inflectional endings, but with its lexical endings in place. For\nexample, chatters has the inflectional root or lemma chatter, but the lexical\nroot chat. Inflectional roots are often called stems, and a root in the stricter\nsense may be thought of as a monomorphemic stem.\n\nThe traditional definition allows roots to be either free morphemes or bound\nmorphemes. Root morphemes are essential for affixation and compounds. However,\nin polysynthetic languages with very high levels of inflectional morphology, the\nterm \"root\" is generally synonymous with \"free morpheme\". Many such languages\nhave a very restricted number of morphemes that can stand alone as a word:\nYup'ik, for instance, has no more than two thousand.\n\nThe root of a word is a unit of meaning (morpheme) and, as such, it is an\nabstraction, though it can usually be represented in writing as a word would be.\nFor example, it can be said that the root of the English verb form running is\nrun, or the root of the Spanish superlative adjective amplÃ­simo is ampl-, since\nthose words are clearly derived from the root forms by simple suffixes that do\nnot alter the roots in any way. In particular, English has very little\ninflection, and hence a tendency to have words that are identical to their\nroots. But more complicated inflection, as well as other processes, can obscure\nthe root; for example, the root of mice is [[mouse]] (still a valid word), and\nthe root of interrupt is, arguably, rupt, which is not a word in English and\nonly appears in derivational forms (such as disrupt, corrupt, rupture, etc.).\nThe root rupt is written as if it were a word, but it's not.\n\nThis distinction between the word as a unit of speech and the root as a unit of\nmeaning is even more important in the case of languages where roots have many\ndifferent forms when used in actual words, as is the case in Semitic languages.\nIn these, roots are formed by consonants alone, and different words (belonging\nto different parts of speech) are derived from the same root by inserting\nvowels. For example, in Hebrew, the root 'gdl' represents the idea of largeness,\nand from it we have 'g'a'd'o'l' and 'gd'o'l'a (masculine and feminine forms of\nthe adjective \"big\"), 'g'a'd'a'l' \"he grew\", hi'gd'i'l' \"he magnified\" and\nma'gd'e'l'et \"magnifier\", along with many other words such as 'g'o'd'e'l' \"size\"\nand mi'gd'a'l' \"tower\".\n","linknr":193,"url":"Root_(linguistics)","recorded":1362565566,"links":50,"instances":["linguistics","linguistics","morphology","chinese_character","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Lexical units"],"headings":["Secondary roots","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f4/Ambox_content.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/f/f2/Edit-clear.svg/40px-Edit-clear.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["lemma","morphology"],["stem","linguistics"],["compound","linguistics"],["lemma","morphology"],["morphology","linguistics"],["radical","chinese_character"]],"members":["stem","compound","lemma","radical","morphology"],"related":["Lexicology","Word","Word_family","Semantics","Content_word","Language","Morpheme","Inflection","Lemma_(morphology)","Stem_(linguistics)","Free_morpheme","Bound_morpheme","Affixation","Compound_(linguistics)","Polysynthetic_language","Yup'ik_language","Semitic_language","Triliteral","Vowel","Hebrew_language","Arabic_language","Ghil'ad_Zuckermann","Palgrave_Macmillan","Semitic_languages","Hebrew","Syriac","Aramaic","Maltese_language","Amharic","Hebrew","Israeli_Hebrew","Biblical_Hebrew","Academy_of_the_Hebrew_Language","Ghil'ad_Zuckermann","Latin_language","Rabbinic_Hebrew","Biblical_Hebrew","Rabbinic_Hebrew","Biblical_Hebrew","Lemma_(morphology)","Lexeme","Morphological_typology","Morphology_(linguistics)","Phono-semantic_matching","Principal_parts","Proto-Indo-European_root","Radical_(Chinese_character)","Semitic_root","Word_family","Word_stem"]}
