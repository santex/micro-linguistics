{"cursor":"3925","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn linguistics, 'derivation' is the process of forming a new word on the basis\nof an existing word, e.g. happi-ness and un-happy from happy, or determination\nfrom determine. Derivation stands in contrast to the process of inflection,\nwhich uses another kind of affix in order to form grammatical variants of the\nsame word, as with determine/determine-s/determin-ing/determin-\ned. Crystal, David (1999): The Penguin Dictionary of Language. - Penguin\nBooks - England. Generally speaking, inflection applies to all members\nof a part of speech (e.g., every English verb has a past-tense form), while\nderivation applies only to some members of a part of speech (e.g., the\nnominalizing suffix -ity can be used with the adjectives modern and dense, but\nnot with open or strong).\n\nA derivational suffix usually applies to words of one syntactic category and\nchanges them into words of another syntactic category. For example,\nthe English derivational suffix -ly changes adjectives into adverbs\n(slow â slowly).\n\nExamples of English derivational patterns and their suffixes:\n\n* adjective-to-noun: -ness (slow â slowness)\n* adjective-to-verb: -ise (modern â modernise) in British English or -ize\n  (archaic â archaicize) in American English and Oxford spelling\n* adjective-to-adjective: -ish (red â reddish)\n* adjective-to-adverb: -ly (personal â personally)\n* noun-to-adjective: -al (recreation â recreational)\n* noun-to-verb: -fy (glory â glorify)\n* verb-to-adjective: -able (drink â drinkable)\n* verb-to-noun (abstract): -ance (deliver â deliverance)\n* verb-to-noun (concrete): -er (write â writer)\n\nAlthough derivational affixes do not necessarily alter the syntactic category,\nthey do change the meaning of the base. In many cases, derivational affixes\nchange both the syntactic category and the meaning: modern â modernize (\"to make\nmodern\"). The change of meaning is sometimes predictable: Adjective + ness â the\nstate of being (Adjective); (whiteâ whiteness).\n\nA prefix (write â re-write; lord â over-lord) will rarely change syntactic\ncategory in English. The prefix un- applies to adjectives (healthy â unhealthy)\nand some verbs (do â undo), but rarely to nouns. A few exceptions are the\nderivational prefixes en- and be-. En- (em- before labials) is usually used as a\ntransitive marker on verbs, but can also be applied to adjectives and nouns to\nform transitive verbs: circle (verb) â encircle (verb); but rich (adj) â enrich\n(verb), large (adj) â enlarge (verb), rapture (noun) â enrapture (verb), slave\n(noun) â enslave (verb).\n\nNote that derivational affixes are bound morphemes. In that respect, derivation\ndiffers from compounding by which free morphemes are combined (lawsuit, Latin\nprofessor). It also differs from inflection in that inflection does not create\nnew lexemes but new word forms (table â tables; open â opened).\n\nDerivation can occur without any change of form, for example telephone (noun)\nand to telephone. This is known as conversion or zero derivation.\n","linknr":135,"url":"Derivation_(linguistics)","recorded":1362375024,"links":34,"instances":["linguistics","linguistics","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Linguistic morphology"],"headings":["References","See also","External links"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0f/Mergefrom.svg/50px-Mergefrom.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["prefix","linguistics"],["prefix","linguistics"],["compound","linguistics"],["conversion","linguistics"]],"members":["compound","conversion","prefix"],"related":["Linguistics","Inflection","Part_of_speech","Affix","Word","Syntactic_category","Syntax","English_language","Affix","Adjective","Adverb","Adjective","Noun","Verb","British_English","American_English","Oxford_spelling","Adverb","Adjective","Syntactic_category","Prefix_(linguistics)","Prefix_(linguistics)","Labial_consonant","Bound_morpheme","Compound_(linguistics)","Inflection","Word_form","Conversion_(linguistics)","Inflection","Nominalization","Word_formation","Collocation","Word_root"]}
