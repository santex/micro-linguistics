{"cursor":"17227","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\n\n\n\n\nIn linguistics, a 'stratum' or 'strate' () is a language that influences, or is\ninfluenced by another through contact. A 'substratum' or 'substrate' is a\nlanguage which has lower power or prestige than another, while a 'superstratum'\nor 'superstrate' is the language that has higher power or prestige. Both\nsubstratum and superstratum languages influence each other, but in different\nways. An 'adstratum' or 'adstrate' refers to a language that is in contact with\nanother language in a neighbor population without having identifiably higher or\nlower prestige. The terms \"superstrate\" and \"adstrate\" were first used by two\ndifferent authors in 1932. \"Why Don't the English Speak Welsh?\" Hildegard\nTristram, in The Britons in Anglo-Saxon England, N. J. Higham (ed.), The Boydell\nPress, pp. 192â214. [http://www.hildegard.tristram.de/media/tristram_manchester_30-07-\n07.pdf]\n\nThus, both terms refer to a situation where an intrusive language establishes\nitself in the territory of another, typically as the result of migration.\nWhether the superstratum case (the local language persists and the intrusive\nlanguage disappears) or the substratum one (the local language disappears and\nthe intrusive language persists) applies will normally only be evident after\nseveral generations, during which the intrusive language exists within a\ndiaspora culture. In order for the intrusive language to persist (substratum\ncase), the immigrant population will either need to take the position of a\npolitical elite or immigrate in significant numbers relative to the local\npopulation (i. e., the intrusion qualifies as an invasion or colonisation, an\nexample would be the Roman Empire giving rise to Romance languages outside of\nItaly, displacing Gaulish and many other languages).\n\nThe superstratum case refers to elite populations which eventually adopt the\nlocal language (an example would be the Burgundians and Franks in France, who\neventually abandoned their Germanic dialects in favor of Romance).\n","linknr":382,"url":"Substratum_(linguistics)","recorded":1362477056,"links":41,"instances":["sociolinguistics","area","political"],"pdf":["http://www.hildegard.tristram.de/media/tristram_manchester_30-07-07.pdf"],"categories":["Language
