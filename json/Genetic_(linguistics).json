{"cursor":"3110","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"\nIn linguistics, 'genetic relationship' is the usual term for the relationship\nwhich exists between languages that are members of the same language family. The\nterm 'genealogical relationship' is sometimes used to avoid confusion with the\nunrelated use of the term in biological genetics. Languages that possess genetic\nties with one another belong to the same linguistic grouping, known as a\nlanguage family. These ties are established through use of the comparative\nmethod of linguistic analysis.\n\nTwo languages are considered to be genetically related if one is descended from\nthe other or if both are descended from a common ancestor. For example, Italian\nis descended from Latin. Italian and Latin are therefore said to be genetically\nrelated. Spanish is also descended from Latin. Therefore, Spanish and Italian\nare genetically related.\n\nContact with another language (language contact) can result in influence\n(linguistic interference and specifically borrowing) by it. For example,\nEnglish has been influenced by French, Persian has been influenced by Arabic,\nand Japanese has been influenced by Chinese. However, this influence by\ndefinition does not constitute a genetic relationship, or relates two very\ndistantly related languages more, as with English and French, which are linked\nby Indo-European.\n\nThe discipline of historical linguistics rests on the theory that almost all of\nthe languages spoken in the world today can be grouped by derivation from common\nancestral languages into a relatively small number of families. For example,\nEnglish is related to other Indo-European languages and more specifically to the\nGermanic family (West Germanic branch), while Mandarin Chinese is related to\nmany other Sino-Tibetan languages.\n","linknr":127,"url":"Genetic_(linguistics)","recorded":1362478797,"links":21,"instances":[],"pdf":[],"categories":["Historical linguistics"],"headings":["Mixed, pidgin and creole languages","See also","References"],"image":["//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png","//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dc/Linguistics_stub.svg/40px-Linguistics_stub.svg.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[],"members":[],"related":["Linguistics","Language","Language_family","Genetics","Language_family","Comparative_method","Italian_language","Latin","Spanish_language","Language_contact","Language_transfer","Loanword","English_language","French_language","Persian_language","Arabic_language","Japanese_language","Chinese_language","Indo-European_language","Historical_linguistics","Theory","Language_family","English_language","Indo-European_languages","Mandarin_Chinese","Sino-Tibetan_languages","Mixed_language","Pidgin","Creole_language","Modern_Hebrew","Semitic","Indo-European","Tree_model","Language_family","Comparative_linguistics","Language_isolate","Sprachbund"]}
