{"cursor":"11828","size":15,"audio":[],"currentlang":"en","article":"A 'sentence' is a grammatical unit consisting of one or more words that that are\ngrammatically linked. A sentence can include words grouped meaningfully to\nexpress a statement, question, exclamation, request, command or\nsuggestion.\n\nA sentence can also be defined in orthographic terms alone, i.e., as anything\nwhich is contained between a capital letter and a full stop. Halliday,\nM.A.K. and Matthiessen, C.M.I.M. 2004. An Introduction to Functional Grammar.\nArnold: p6. For instance, the opening of Charles Dickens' novel Bleak\nHouse begins with the following three sentences:\n\n:London. Michaelmas term lately over, and the Lord Chancellor sitting in\nLincoln's Inn Hall. Implacable November weather.\n\nThe first sentence involves one word, a proper noun. The second sentence has\nonly a non-finite verb. The third is a single nominal group. Only an\northographic definition encompasses this variation.\n\nAs with all language expressions, sentences might contain function and content\nwords and contain properties distinct to natural language, such as\ncharacteristic intonation and timing patterns.\n\nSentences are generally characterized in most languages by the presence of a\nfinite verb, e.g. \"The quick brown fox ''jumps'' over the lazy dog\".\n","linknr":388,"url":"Sentence_(linguistics)","recorded":1362553637,"links":84,"instances":["grammar","grammar","phonetics","linguistics","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Semantic units","Statements","Syntactic entities"],"headings":["Components of a sentence","Classification","Sentence length","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["intonation","linguistics"],["subject","grammar"],["copula","linguistics"],["subject","grammar"],["predicate","grammar"],["phone","phonetics"]],"members":["predicate","subject","phone","intonation","copula"],"related":["Grammar","Word","Question","Imperative_mood","Suggestion","Charles_Dickens","Bleak_House","Non-finite_verb","Nominal_group","Language","Function_word","Content_word","Intonation_(linguistics)","Finite_verb","The_quick_brown_fox_jumps_over_the_lazy_dog","Clause","Subject_(grammar)","Finite_verb","Phrase","Gerund","Copula_(linguistics)","English_language","Finite_verb","Clause","Independent_clause","Dependent_clause","Grammatical_conjunction","Punctuation","Question","Rhetorical_question","Imperative_mood","Subject_(grammar)","Predicate_(grammar)","Nominal_sentence","Sentence_words","Sentence_words","Phone_(phonetics)","Affirmation","Assertion","Grammatical_polarity","Inflectional_phrase","Periodic_sentence","Sentence_arrangement","Sentence_function","T-unit"]}
