Neither does the presence of\nincorporation in a language imply that that language is polysynthetic.\n","linknr":150,"url":"Incorporation_(linguistics)","recorded":1362674966,"links":24,"instances":["linguist","linguistics","linguistics","linguistics"],"pdf":["http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/faculty/mithun/pdfs/1984%20The%20evolution%20of%20noun%20incorporation.PDF","http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/faculty/mithun/pdfs/1986%20On%20the%20nature%20on%20noun%20incorporation.PDF","http://www.linguistics.ucsb.edu/faculty/mithun/pdfs/2009%20Polysynthesis%20in%20the%20Arctic.PDF","http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~mbarrie/Barrie2006Dissertation.pdf"],"categories":["Linguistic typology"],"headings":["Examples of incorporation","Semantics of noun incorporation","Syntax of noun incorporation","Incorporation in diachronic perspective","References"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["compound","linguistics"],["compound","linguistics"],["root","linguistics"],["classifier","linguistics"],["nicholas_evans","linguist"]],"members":["nicholas_evans","classifier","root","compound"],"related":["Verb","Compound_(linguistics)","Direct_object","Adverb","Syntax","Polysynthetic_language","Polysynthesis","English_language","Direct_object","Back-formation","Compound_(linguistics)","Oneida_language","Iroquoian","Epenthetic","Panare_language","Chukchi_language","Paleosiberian_language","Mohawk_language","Iroquoian_languages","Root_(linguistics)","Cheyenne_language","Algonquian_languages","Yucatec_Maya_language","Lahu_language","Tibeto-Burman_languages","Japanese_language","Syntax","Verb_argument","Lakota_language","Siouan_languages","Oneida_language","Iroquoian_language","Classifier_(linguistics)","Nicholas_Evans_(linguist)","Alfred_L._Kroeber","Guillaume_Jacques","Diane_Massam","Marianne_Mithun","Jerrold_Sadock","Edward_Sapir","Robert_Van_Valin,_Jr.","Randy_LaPolla"]}
