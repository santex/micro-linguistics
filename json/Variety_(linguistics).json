Schilling-Estes, Natalies.\n(2006) \"Dialect variation.\" In R.W. Fasold and J. Connor-Linton (eds) An\nIntroduction to Language and Linguistics. pp. 311-341. Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press. Linguists speak of both standard and non-standard\nvarieties. \"Lect\" avoids the problem in ambiguous cases of deciding whether or\nnot two varieties are distinct languages or dialects of a single language.\n\nVariation at the level of the lexicon, such as slang and argot, is often\nconsidered in relation to particular styles or levels of formality (also called\nregisters), but such uses are sometimes discussed as varieties themselves.\n","linknr":235,"url":"Variety_(linguistics)","recorded":1362480891,"links":41,"instances":["sociolinguistics","linguistics","sociolinguistics","linguistics"],"pdf":[],"categories":["Language varieties and styles|","Sociolinguistics"],"headings":["Dialects","Standard varieties","Registers and styles","Idiolect","See also","References","External links"],"image":["//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/vector/images/search-ltr.png?303-4","//bits.wikimedia.org/images/wikimedia-button.png","//bits.wikimedia.org/static-1.21wmf10/skins/common/images/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png"],"tags":[["accent","sociolinguistics"],["register","sociolinguistics"],["stylistics","linguistics"],["accent","sociolinguistics"],["morphology","linguistics"]],"members":["register","stylistics","accent","morphology"],"related":["Sociolinguistics","Language","Language_cluster","Language","Dialect","Accent_(sociolinguistics)","Register_(sociolinguistics)","Stylistics_(linguistics)","Standard_language","Lexicon","Slang","Argot","Phonology","Syntax","Lexicon","Regional_dialect","Topolect","Varieties_of_Chinese","Ethnolect","Social_class","Sociolect","Dialectology","Speech_community","Sociolinguistics","Community_of_practice","Penelope_Eckert","Sally_McConnell-Ginet","Accent_(sociolinguistics)","Pronunciation","Morphology_(linguistics)","Arbitrariness","Académie_française","Grammar","Child-directed_speech","Teasing","The_dozens","Jargon","Style-shifting","Cuba_–_United_States_relations","Washington,_DC","Colloquialism","Code-switching","Style_shifting","Multilingual","Linguistic_competence","Ausbausprache_-_Abstandsprache_-_Dachsprache","Language_localization","List_of_language_subsystems"]}
